# Gloria Jean's Coffees Sales & Customer Analytics

## üåê Project Background

Gloria Jean's Coffees is a well-known coffeehouse chain aiming to grow its presence in cities across Bangladesh. While the brand has developed a decent customer base and product portfolio, there is significant potential for growth in both customer retention and operational efficiency. The goal of this project is to analyze historical sales, customer behavior, and market size in order to:

* Identify high-performing and underperforming cities
* Improve product profitability
* Increase customer retention
* Optimize rent-to-revenue efficiency

This end-to-end analysis leverages transactional, demographic, and product data to deliver business-ready insights for decision-makers. The project simulates a real-world scenario where a data analyst presents a stakeholder-facing analysis to inform market strategy, operations, and customer engagement.

> This repository functions as a professional deliverable. Stakeholders (e.g., CEOs, COOs, or marketing analysts) can review insights within one click. Technical SQL scripts are available in a separate folder.
