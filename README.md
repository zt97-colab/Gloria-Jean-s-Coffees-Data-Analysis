# Gloria Jean's Coffees Sales & Customer Analytics

## üåê Project Background

Gloria Jean's Coffees is a well-known coffeehouse chain aiming to grow its presence in cities across Bangladesh. While the brand has developed a decent customer base and product portfolio, there is significant potential for growth in both customer retention and operational efficiency. The goal of this project is to analyze historical sales, customer behavior, and market size in order to:

* Identify high-performing and underperforming cities
* Improve product profitability
* Increase customer retention
* Optimize rent-to-revenue efficiency

This end-to-end analysis leverages transactional, demographic, and product data to deliver business-ready insights for decision-makers. The project simulates a real-world scenario where a data analyst presents a stakeholder-facing analysis to inform market strategy, operations, and customer engagement.

> This repository functions as a professional deliverable. Stakeholders (e.g., CEOs, COOs, or marketing analysts) can review insights within one click. Technical SQL scripts are available in a separate folder.

## üï∞Ô∏è Insights Deep Dive

### Advanced SQL Techniques:

* Implemented linear regression using REGR_SLOPE and REGR_INTERCEPT functions for 3-month revenue forecasting per city.

* Developed Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) segmentation using NTILE window functions to score and classify customers into five behavioral groups: Champion, Loyal, Potential, At Risk, and Others.

* Leveraged window functions, conditional aggregation (FILTER, CASE), and joins to compute detailed business KPIs and segment counts.

### Forecasting:

* Built a 3-month city-level revenue projection model based on historical monthly sales trends to aid leadership in budgeting and resource allocation.

### Customer Churn Detection:

* Defined churn as customers with no purchases in the last 90+ days. 

* Quantified churn risk by city to prioritize retention marketing campaigns.

### Rent-to-Revenue Efficiency:

* Calculated metrics such as rent per customer and revenue per rent unit to identify operationally efficient cities and inform cost optimization.

### Product Profitability:

* Estimated product profitability by assuming 60% of price as cost, identifying top-performing and underperforming products for targeted product strategy

### Sales & Revenue:
