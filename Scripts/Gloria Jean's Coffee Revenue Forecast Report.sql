Revenue Forecast Report â€“ 3-Month Projection
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - This report forecasts total revenue for each city for the next 3 months 
      using linear regression on historical monthly revenue.

Highlights:
    1. Aggregates historical monthly revenue per city.
    2. Applies linear regression using REGR_SLOPE and REGR_INTERCEPT to estimate trend.
    3. Projects revenue for the next 3 months per city based on trend continuation.
    4. Identifies cities with upward, stable, or declining revenue patterns.

Use Cases:
    - Helps leadership with strategic planning, resource allocation, and budgeting.
    - Reveals which markets are growing and need investment vs. declining markets that need attention.
